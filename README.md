# The-models-for-nephrotoxicity
Six models were provided for prediction of drug-induced nephrotoxicity
Reliable prediction models of drug-induced nephrotoxicity were developed by using machine learning algorithms and molecular fingerprints. These models can predict not only the nephrotoxicity of Chinese herbal medicines but also that of synthetic drugs, and structural alerts that may cause drug-induced nephrotoxicity were also identified.
The algorithm and fingerprint corresponding to the file:
anngra.pickle → ANN_GraphFP
annpub.pickle → ANN_PubChemFP
gbmgra.pickle → LightGBM_GraphFP
gbmkr.pickle → LightGBM_KRFP
rfgra.pickle → RF_GraphFP
svmgra.pickle → SVM_GraphFP
For academic use, not for commercial use.Thanks a lot!
